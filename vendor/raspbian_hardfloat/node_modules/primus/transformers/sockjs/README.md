# Transformer: SockJS

A transformer abstraction for the SockJS framework.

# Compiling the SockJS client library

There isn't a client distribution of SockJS available in npm so we need to ship
it inside of Primus.

1. Clone the repository: `git@github.com:sockjs/sockjs-client.git`
2. cd in to the directory && `npm install . && make`
3. Override the `library.js` with the newly created `sockjs.js`
4. Commit changes in Primus
5. Profit.
