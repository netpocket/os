Features I want to see next:

* Built-in code editor (codemirror)
  - settings tab (editing the etc/device.json directly)
    - this gets linted by jslint on the client side
    - it also gets linted by our own rules
      e.g. must have a name
    - this is how you will configure wifi for now
  - allow user view source, add, and edit features/tasks
* faster still capture
  - keep camera process open, send Enter on 'get still'
* video streaming
* audio streaming
